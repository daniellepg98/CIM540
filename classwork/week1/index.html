    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm Danielle and I go to school at the University of Miami. I'm a sophomore studying creative advertising with a minor in psychology. I'm from New York and I have 3 siblings- an identical twin and 2 older brothers. Growing up in New York was great because even though I didn't live directly in the city it was just a train ride away.</p>
