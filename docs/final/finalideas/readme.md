Project ideas:

1) A backyard or farm scene with several animals: example: cow, pig, horse, chicken. When you click on each one they do something and there are sound effects

Can the animals/scene be illustrated in illustrator?

2) A guessing game where you have to find certain things hidden in a room: can code a panning of the room with the movement of the mouse (so like a coded microscope) The person can win or lose the game depending on how many out of the ordinary objects they find

3) A maze game where you're timed to complete a maze and there are obstacles along the way
