For the first version of my code, I worked on creating the first scene in my game, I created a variable for an array of images so that when users click on the objects the program can recognize what image they're clicking on. I preloaded sounds for example of a timer ticking so the user can be aware that they're being timed- I made the timer by putting a timer in the html as a paragraph and then grabbing that to put in the sketch. I used a counter so it could go off every second. The problem I've come across is figuring out how to display the text for the future objects for the user to press, as well as knowing how to switch from scenes.
