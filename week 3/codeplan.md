## Code Plan
### I made a calculator that determines how old someone is in dog years. The user enters their age and the calculator returns the age they are in dog years


## The calculator includes:

#### inputs

#### output

#### message telling user their age in dog years

###### First, the user has to tell me their age. I'll create a form text input so they can type it in. Then the user will have to click the button to calculate their result. I'll make a button for that. When the user clicks the button that says "calculate" I will need to activate the calculation function I created. In the function, I'll need the value of the form input. I'll divide that number by 1 and multiply it by 7 to get the result. The result will be a returned message to the user how old they are in dog years.
